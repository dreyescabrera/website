## From Mobile App Refinements to a Full-fledged Web Platform

When I joined TORQ, an early-stage startup, the team had big dreams but faced some hurdles. With only one full-stack developer on board, design inconsistencies in the Flutter mobile app were affecting the user experience. That's where I stepped in.

Starting as a frontend developer, I dove into the codebase and quickly got to work. Once I understood the architecture, I began delivering real impact to thousands of users. My role grew from solving issues and ensuring smooth app performance to shipping new features driven by user feedback.

## TORQ Web: My Most Complex Project Yet

While I've contributed to countless features, the TORQ web application stands out as my proudest achievement. I took full ownership of this project—from its inception to launch. Unlike the mobile app, the web version isn't just a replica; it includes game-changing features like team accounts. Now, contractors can create teams and add members on the fly—a must-have for fast-paced home services.

## Perfecting Every Pixel

Whether it's the web or mobile app, every detail has been carefully considered. Every interaction and every pixel is crafted with precision to ensure the user experience is nothing short of impeccable. From the way buttons respond to clicks to the seamless dark mode toggle, it's all about creating a product that feels intuitive and effortless to use.

## The Impact

Working at TORQ has been a journey of growth and creativity. I've contributed to features that thousands of users rely on daily and helped transform the company's tech stack into something scalable and efficient. The TORQ web launch marked a turning point, showing what's possible when design, engineering, and user needs align.
