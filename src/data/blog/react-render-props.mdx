React Render Props is a feature that allows you to pass custom props to a component. This is useful when you want to customize the behavior of a component without having to modify its source code.

## Example

Here is an example of how you can use React Render Props to pass a custom `className` prop to a component:

{/* ```jsx
import React from "react";

const CustomButton = ({ className }) => (
  <button className={className}>Click me</button>
); */}
