      I'm Diego, a software engineer and web specialist with over 4 years of
      experience, and every project I deliver carries my personal watermark: an
      obsessive attention to detail, from performance optimization to
      pixel-perfect responsiveness.

    <p>
      No one cares more about getting it right than I do.
      <br />
      If you're going to do it, do it <em>well.</em>
