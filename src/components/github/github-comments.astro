/* 
  This component generates this error in the console:

    Warning: Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component. This could happen for one of the following reasons:
      1. You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer (such as React DOM)
      2. You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks
      3. You might have more than one copy of React in the same app

  It can be safely ignored.
  https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/12802
  Adding `client:only="react"` to the component fixes the issue.
